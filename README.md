This project is an implementation of a face recognition system using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The notebook face_recognition.ipynb contains the complete code and step-by-step explanation of the process, focusing on face recognition using images of five Avengers: Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr., and Scarlett Johansson.
